    "stabilization": "Properties such as Total Energy, Kinetic Energy, Potential Energy, System Volume, Pressure and Density should remain constant during the trajectory in NPT or NVT ensembles, If the temperature is increased, then a proportional increase in kinetic energy will be observed. Also, during equilibration, the volume of the system may increase durig NP simulations in order to accomodate the lost of the crystallographic conformation and the consequent expansion of the protein loops and side-chains in the presence of water molecules. For simulation of biological systems, these analyses are usually to guarante the minimum stability of the system. But if changes in the conditions are performed such as modifications in temperature and pressure, or the use of solvents different fromwater, a carefull anaysis of these properties shoud be performed in order to allow a proper reproduction of experimental values - considering that the solvent was prevously validated.

    "rmsd": "The RMSD (root mean square deviation) of a given molecule is calculated  by least-square fitting the structure to the reference structure, that is, the starging conformation (w = 0), using the following equation  \\begin{equation} \\label{eq:rmsd} RMSD (v, w)= \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}  \\left \\| v_i - w_i \\right \\|^2 } \\end{equation} A delicate topic is the use of RMSD as an indication of a simulation convergence. Whereas it is common to consider the stability of this property as an indication of the system convergence, it is most likely related to an insuficient sampling and increased rigidity of the force field. It is well recognized today in the community that a time scale of at least miliseconds would be necessary to properly sample most of proteins (a smaller time scale would be expected to smaller proteins and peptides, potentially on the microsecond time scale). So more important than to indicate convergence, the RMSD indicates how a molecule conformation is changed during the trajectory. The significance of this modification, high or low, would be strongly related to specific characteristics of the simulated system (such as a high amount of loop, presence of hinge domains or multiple domains), considering that problems on the starting structure, force field adequacy and system set up are eliminated.",
    "rmsdf": "One of the main indications of the system flexibility is derived from the RMSF (Root MeanSquare Fluctuation), that correspond to the standard deviation of atomic positions in the trajectory. While the crystallographic reference is not directly present in the analysis, it may appear indirectly in the change of flexibility during time. In other words, the lost of the crystallographic conformation may be associated to a higher flexibility and, when a solution-like conformation is achieved, the degree of residue flexibility is lower. One strategy to observe this behaviour is to produce a heat map based on RMSF, in which the change in atomic positions is evauated in small time windows. For proteins, it is more usual to present the RMSF as a function of residue number, and for small ligands as a function of atom number.",
    "sasa": "The solvent accessible surface area (SAS) is calculated for its hydrophobic, hydrophilic and total components based on the double cubic lattice method (Eisenhaber F, Lijnzaad P, Argos P, Sander C, Scharf M (1995) J. Comput. Chem. 16, 273-284). It's increase or decrease indicate the exposure or hinding of hydrophobic or hydrophilic regions in the protein, that is, a conformational change. In the situation of a change, similarly to RMSD, the molecular determinants for this change could be informative about the protein properties.",
    "protein_dinamics" : "When the RMSD is analyzed, it indicates the stability of the experimental conformational information during the simulation trajectory, as an average along the entire protein. As a consequence, local modifications could occur and not be seen. Additionally, RMSD can lack sensbility to detect minor or local conformational modifications on the simulated protein. One strategy to access the protein conformational behavior in a residue level is to evaluate the stability of its secondary structure elements. While this is not a simple problem, and several different approaches to detech secondary structure have been proposed, the Kabsch and Sander dictionary of protein secondary structure (DSSP) is one of the most widely employed methods, based on a combination of hydrogen bonding and geometric features extracted from X-ray structures. The result of this analysis could be detailed or not at the residue level."
