             entry lines can be correctly processed.

             in FEW.pl requesting download of this module from CPAN by the user, if
             the module cannot be found.

2013-06-10 : Renamed miscellaneous script kruskal.pl to identify_transformations.pl
             and added message to identify_transformations.pl requesting download
             and installation of Graph::Kruskal, if module is not found.

2013-06-11 : Renamed additional module Atom.pm to AtomWithType.pm and added detailed
             description of modifications made in the Atom.pm module.

             present.

2014-12-10 : Fixed bug in handling of protein files in which some of the cysteins are
             connected via S-S-bonds. Made path detection independent of directory in which
             FEW resides. 

2015-01-14 : Fixed bug in CYS -> CYX renaming section, to ensure that the renaming section
             is only processed if file with disulfide-bridge definition is provided.

             connected via S-S-bonds in TI setup.

2015-02-24 : New procedure for handling of imaged trajectories implemented. This new functio-
             nality allows to keep imaged files and to use them for more than one analysis.

2015-02-25 : Imaging with respect to the geometric center was made the default procedure to
             ensure consistency the with imaging procedure used for implicit membrane MM-PBSA
             calculations. 'image_mass_origin' keyword was introduced to ensure backwards
             compartibility.

             based procedure.

             version distributed before this date using parmchk of Amber14 or Amber12,
             respectively.
