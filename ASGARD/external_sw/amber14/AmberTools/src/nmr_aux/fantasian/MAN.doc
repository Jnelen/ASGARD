INPUT FILES:

Observed shifts file (pcshifts.in):  

     1st    column   -->   residue number
     2nd    column   -->   residue name
     3rd    column   -->   proton name
     4th    column   -->   observed pseudocontact shift value
     5th    column   -->   multiplicity of the NMR signal (for example 
                           it is 3 for of a methyl group)
     6th    column   -->   relative tolerance
     7th    column   -->   relative weight

Amber pdb file (parm.pdb): coordinates file in PDB format. If you need to
                           use a solution NMR family of structures you have
                           to superimpose the structures before to use them.



OUTPUT FILES:

Observed out file (obs.out): This file is built and read by the program itself,
                             and reports the data read from the input files.

output file (res.out):   The main output file. In this file the result of the
                         fitting is reported. Using fantasian it is possible to
                         define an internal reference system to visualize the
                         orientation of the tensor axes. Then in this file
                         you can find PDB format lines (ATOM) which can be 
                         included in a PDB file to visualize the internal 
                         reference system and the tensor axes. In the main
                         output file all the three equivalent permutations of
                         the tensor parameters with respect to the
                         reference system are reported. The summary of 
                         the minimum and maximum errors and that of errors^2 
                         are also reported. 
                             
EXAMPLE FILES: in the directory example there are all the files necessary 
               to run a fantasian calculation:

                  fantasian.com  --> run file
                  pcshifts.in    --> observed shifts file
                  parm.pdb       --> coordinate file in PDB format
                  obs.out        --> data read from input files
                  res.out        --> main output file 


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes for the Nov. 1999 version:


The starting input data (but NOT the input file format) required 
by Fantasian are changed with respect to previous version.

The following is an example of a script file, to run Fantasian in case
of three paramagnetic centers.
