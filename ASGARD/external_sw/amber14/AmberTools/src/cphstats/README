This is a program for analyzing the results of constant pH MD simulations (and
constant pH replica exchange MD simulations) that you can run using the Amber
programs `sander' and `pmemd'. Support in pmemd was added after the release of
Amber 12 and will be available in Amber 14 in 2014. Likewise, support for
pH-REMD will be available in Amber 14 as well.

This program replicates the (limited) functionality of the Fortran program
calcpka.F90 (which I wrote a couple years ago) that is released with AmberTools.
The original implementation, calcpka.pl, written by John Mongan in ca. 2004, was
too slow for analyzing the larger files you can produce with faster computers
(and, of course, GPUs).

I decided to rewrite the program rather than add on to calcpka.F90 since Fortran
really was the wrong tool to use for this application, and modifying the program
to do what I needed it to do would have been difficult. I still included some
Fortran code to parse the namelist input (since certain cprestart files are
Fortran-generated and may have a format that is compiler-dependent).

Therefore, building this program requires a working Fortran and C++ compiler
with the ability to cross-link them. There is a configure script that will build
a config.h file. Both the intel and GNU compilers are supported. To build the
program, type:

./configure --prefix /path/to/install/location gnu
make && make install

By default, the prefix /usr/local.  If you wish to install in your home
directory, run

./configure --prefix $HOME gnu
make && make install

This will create a program "cphstats" in the prefix/bin directory. You can run

cphstats --help

to get a full usage statement.
