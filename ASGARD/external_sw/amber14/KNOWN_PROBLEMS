Here is a list of known bugs and issues with Amber and AmberTools
-----------------------------------------------------------------

- The sander API is known to seg-fault with some versions of the Intel and PGI
  compilers on some machines. These are revealed in the test suite.

- Parts of the sander API do not work with GCC 4.1.2, and the tests will report
  failures when run with those compilers.

- FFTW3 does not work with GCC 4.1.2, so RISM and mdgx will not work, and the
  mdgx tests will report known failures
